		<h3>Blog <a href="https://blog.kgivler.com">(blog.kgivler.com)</a></h3>
		<br>
		<p class="pb-4">
			"Blog" is blogging platform created as a work along project for Coder Foundry's self-paced full-stack development course.
			I allows multiple blogs to be created which can contain tagged posts. I'm not much of one for writing, but I may use it
			to track progress on interesting programming projects or post solutions to programming problems I encounter along the way.
			The blog will likely evolve over time as I make it more my own, especially if I do end up posting to it!

		<h3>DiscordBot <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/DiscordBot">(GitHub)</a></h3>
		<p class="pb-4">
			<br>
			One of my larger personal projects, a Discord bot. DiscordBot primarily has moderation commands
			as well as most of the other common
			commands you would expect from a Discord bot. The full list of commands can be found in the
			<a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/DiscordBot/blob/main/README.md">README</a> file. I
			originally did not intend for this to become a long term project, but I have had so much fun
			working on it that I decided to keep going forward with it. I will be using this to increase my web
			development skills as well. Currently the bot sends command usage statistics to an API next I plan
			on creating a website to display usage statistics from the API.

		<h3>Time Tracker <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/TimeTracker">(GitHub)</a></h3><br>
		<p class="pb-4">
			Time Tracker allows tracking the amount of time spent on projects. Categories and
			subcategories can be used to organize projects. Entries can then be added to these project. The
			total time spent on
			all projects can then be tracked, along with the amount of time spent per project, category and
			subcategory. It has the option to use a sqlite or SQL Server database. I may also add a web front end at some point.<br>

		<h3>Random GitHub <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/Random_GitHub">(GitHub)</a></h3>
		<p class="pb-4">
			<br>
			This application uses the offical GitHub API to find a random GitHub Repository. For now
			this is a simple single WinForm application, with plans to expand the amount of information
			shown and create a web frontend. <br />

		<h3>HappyIRC <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/HappyIRC">(GitHub)</a></h3> <br>
		<p class="pb-4">
			HappyIRC is a project I attempted, but struggled some with the design. The intention of this
			project is to implement a fully RFC compliant IRC Client and Server Library in C#, and use
			these
			libraries to create: A Console IRC client, One or more GUI IRC clients (WinForms, WPF,
			possibly ASP.NET), and finally an IRC server. I plan to revisit this project at a later
			date, as I beleive currently
			a better use of my free time is to learn more front-end web technologies before revisting
			this project.

		<h3>File Joiner <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/FileJoiner">(Github)</a></h3><br>
		<p class="pb-4">
			A simple application for joining any type of file. I do plan to also make a file splitter eventually!<br>

		<h3>Polling API <a href="https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/Poll">(GitHub)</a></h3><br>
		<p class="pb-4">
			An API for creating, voting on, and getting the results for polls. I wrote this with the
			intention of interacting with with a (private source code) Discord bot for a server I am
			a part of.
