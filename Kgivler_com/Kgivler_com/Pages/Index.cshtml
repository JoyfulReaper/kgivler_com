		<p>
			I am a full stack .NET developer and I have a chihuahua named Shelly. I am extremely passionate about development and technology.
			I enjoy backend development, while striving to also have the ability to effectively utilize frontend technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am genuinely fond of working with C#/.NET/ASP.NET. Most of my expereince with ASP.NET is using MVC and Razor Pages, however I am excited to continue
			learning more about REST API and Blazor. Recently I have also had the opportunity to work with VB.NET and Web Forms legacy applications, mostly porting them
			from Visual Basic to C#/.NET 6.
